# Go Implementation

Go was the second language I used for this project. Translating my code from PHP to Go seemed like a valuable exercise, since at the time I was applying for a programming position focussed on exactly that task.

My original, somewhat naive idea was that I would knock up a quick Perl script to do the translation. I quickly learned that it might not be quite that easy. Things are done differently in Go!

I am actually really enjoying my preliminary forays into Go, and would certainly love to do more with the language. In the process of developing this code, I learned a whole lot; I also expanded the original scope of my *Game of Life* implementation, and will need to roll some of the additional aspects of this version back into my PHP implementation, at some point.

Also, I want my *next* project (or the one after) to be "Go in Go"; an implementation of the Japanese board game in this language. How well that will work, given I have the barest concept of how to play Go, and the language Go doesn't have any GUI capability, I'm not sure, but it's definitely on my TODO list.
