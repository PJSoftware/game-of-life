# GoPython Implementation

Python was the third language I used for this project. It is a language I have been wanting to delve into for quite a few years now, but I only ever found a couple of opportunities to actually do anything with it, so it was high on my list!

Translating my existing code into Python was fairly straightforward, but I fell afoul of the range() function: I was expecting something like Perl's "for my $i (1..10)", but to achieve the same result in Python, it's necessary to use "for i in range(1, 11)"! (*This does make sense, if you squint -- the "for i in range(10)" usage will give you 10 steps from 0 to 9.*)
