# PHP Implementation

PHP was the first language I used for this project.

Probably the language I know best is Perl, but PHP would be a close second, and so I wanted to dive in first with PHP to give myself a small refresher; nothing too tricky while I tried to figure out how to get the code working.

## TODO

Of course, this version outputs direct to console; it would be nice to also produce a version that outputs to a web page--perhaps one that detects its environment and does either.
